//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play
/*:
 In this Playground we explore one of the 'Hello World' examples for Machine Learning - the MNIST dataset. The MNIST data is composed of handwritten digits. The dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example is a fixed 28x28 single channel (gray) digit (0-9) that has been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
 
 This is considered a supervised multi-class classification problem, supervised because we have labels for each example and multi-class because we have 10 classes (0-9).
 
 It is comprised of 63 observations with 1 input variable and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:
 - Number of claims.
 - Total payment for all claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor.
 
 Further details can be found [here.](http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/slr/frames/slr06.html)
 The original dataset can be found [here.](https://www.math.muni.cz/~kolacek/docs/frvs/M7222/data/AutoInsurSweden.txt)
